#<b> Credits </b> <br>
The library was developed by me, taking inspiration from rtflib v1.0. I've made several changes to taxonomy of files, for a better readability and mantainability and I've added bookmarks, hyperlinks, header and footer formatting. I've made loading images work on all the platform (the original library uses Windows API for reading images). It could be made better (I'm a noob LoL), but I've done the best I could. Please help me if you want, feel free to pull requests on this repo and help me providing a complete library. All the people involved in developing will be mentioned in the following section.
